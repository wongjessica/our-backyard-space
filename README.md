## Inspiration

Our mission with Our Backyard Space is to foster an amazing collaborative community for everyone who loves the outdoors! Everyone has their own definition of cozy and comfortable, so why not share your space for others to see? People can gain inspiration and help each other out and ask questions! We foster and value community and hope everyone feels safe and happy here!

## What it does

Here, you can upload photo submissions of anything outdoorsy related, especially backyard photos! You can also optionally write down what you want to say about the photo, and the username you want to go by! Then I will manually post them to my gallery for everyone to see! Examples can be seen on the website! You can ask for ideas, inspiration, or flex your beautiful outside outdoorsy backyard pictures.

## How I built it

I built this web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SCSS, Bootstrap, Flask, and Google App Engine!

## Challenges I ran into

I initially wanted to build a React web application where, instead of submitting images through a Google Form, users would be able to create their own accounts using JWT authentication, and would be able to upload their own images on the spot! I also wanted users to be able to collaborate with one another, commenting on each other's images, giving positive feedback and reinforcement, because I think that's so important, to just be able to give and take good vibes. I also wanted to create a forums page or a commenting section where people would be able to ask each other questions regarding the outdoor life, (how to renovate your backyard), or the hiking life (recommendations on what to pack/wear). That is how I wanted to create the sense of community. However, unfortunately, I ran into a lot of troubles with React and I spent hours trying to fix it. In the end, I decided to just switch to vanilla website creation! Also, all the complications with hosting it on Google Cloud's App Engine was hard, but I managed to pull through!

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I am very proud that I was able to create a full website using HTML and CSS. I think it looks great, and I love it a lot. 

## What I learned

I learned a lot of things along the way, not only did I learn a lot about the technologies Google App Engine and Flask, but I learned how to manage my time efficiently. Honestly, I did not think I was going to submit this project in time, but I tried my best with what I had and I pulled through, and I'm so happy.

## What's next for our backyard space

I hope to complete my MVPs soon! I am proud of what I was able to accomplish in this short amount of time. I hope you all like this project! I had a lot of fun working on it!
