        <div>“Whenever you’re ready to talk, I’m ready to listen.”

        <div>“I know life can be overwhelming sometimes. So, if you need to talk, I’m here.”</div>

        <h2>Things to do during social distancing to maintain good mental health</h2>
        <div>Stay connected - FaceTime, call, and text your friends
        </div>
        <div>Meditation/breathing exercises - calms you down
        </div>
        <div>Be kind - when you do something nice for someone else, your brain’s pleasure and reward centers light up. This is known as ‘helper’s high’. </div>
        <div>See this quarantine as an opportunity - do things which you’ve wanted to do but never had the time to do.
